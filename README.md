# TestHarness

Visual test harness for rich client-side JavaScript applications.

--------

### Install using NPM

    npm install testharness
  

### Including TestHarness in your [Express](http://expressjs.com/) application

```coffee-script

  # Create the server.
  express = require 'express'
  app = express.createServer()

  # Configure your app as you please
  # ...

  # Turn on the TestHarness.
  require('testharness').configure app

  # Start
  app.listen process.env.PORT ?= 8000

```

The **TestHarness** will be available on `http://localhost:8000/testharness`

If you wish to have the harness on a different URL, pass the **baseUrl**
option to `configure` like this:

```coffee-script

  require('testharness').configure app, baseUrl: '/foo'

```
